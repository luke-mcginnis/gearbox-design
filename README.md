# Gearbox Design Project

This was my final project for ME 330: Machine Design. The project goal was to design a three-stage gearbox using machine design principles including fatigue and failure analysis, material selection, bearing selection, and the AGMA design process. The end deliverables for this project were a [final report](/report.pdf) and gearbox powertrain CAD.
